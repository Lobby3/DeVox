# The Graph - DeVox Subgraph

## Deployment to The Graph Hosted Service

### Update `networks.json` if required

This file contains the addresses for the contracts that the subgraph will listen to:

``` json
{

  "goerli": {
    "BaalSummoner": {
      "address": "0x7e988A9db2F8597735fc68D21060Daed948a3e8C"
    },
    "Baal": {
    },
    "DeVoxShamanSummonerV1": {
      "address": "0x9f723A885108236E478FC5E31ff90E60E300876D"
    },
    "DeVoxShamanV1": {
    }
  }
}
```

BaalSummoner is a standard DAOhaus deployed contract instance and the address should not change.

DeVoxShamanSummonerV1 is the address of the proxy. This can change if a fresh deployment occurs, but not in the case of an upgrade.
